## What is a SOU?

A Self Organizing Unorganization is a way for multiple people to work together on a shared profit-seeking endeavor without *requiring* leadership or [organizational mutexes](/mutexes.html).

If you want a one-sentence definition of freedom, how about *the ability to do interesting things with other people*. This is the point of a SOU.

Organizations are fundamentally composed of human action (and *inter*-action), so this is the primitive we must work with.

The usefulness of a bucket exists due to the limitations or restrictions imposed by its base and sides. A bucket is useful because it holds water by creating *boundary conditions* on what the water *cannot* do while *remaining in the bucket*.

An ASIC provides boundary conditions on *energy* to focus it towards computing a sha256 sum for fun and profit.

A Nostrocket SOU provides boundary conditions on human action to focus it towards increasing the revenue (and participation) of an open source project.

What a Nostrocket SOU does with humans is analogous to what a bucket does with water and what an ASIC does with energy. 

A SOU is defined by the boundary conditions it places on human action - what type of action humans can perform within the organization.

### Can the shareholders in a Nostrocket SOU conduct a rug-pull?

Possibly, and that would be a shame. 

There's only *one* way to reliably secure a system against a rug-pull, and that's proof of energy.

Unfortunately, proof of energy is only useful for a money, and not a flexible organisation of humans performing a variety of work in pursuit of shared values.

The way that Nostrocket mitigates against this risk is to use the concept of [Votepower](/protocol.html), and [Blackball Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackballing).

It should theoretically take just *one* very determined individual within a Nostrocket SOU to prevent any kind of rug-pull attempt.
