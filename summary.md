## What is Nostr

Nostr stands for **Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays**.  

Nostr has grown from 50 active users a year ago to 300,000 today.  

Nostr is not an app or service that you sign up for, it's a permissionless open standard like TCP/IP and HTTP.  

Anyone can build on it without asking for permission from anyone. There is no one in control.

Nostr is designed for simplicity and enables people to participate in a decentralized social network. It can not only replace twitter/facebook/instagram/spotify/etc but can also replace companies that provide infomation exchange services. 

### Nostr vs Web3
Hong Kong is currently pursuing *Web3*. 

Nostr + Bitcoin + Lightning is an organic form of "Web3" that has a chance of being around in 5-10 years.

Nostr + Bitcoin + Lightning are networks and technologies that are *discovered* in response to *real* problems experienced by *real* people. 

These networks are rapidly growing *without* a development team, without a marketing team, without leadership, and without any form of capital raise.
