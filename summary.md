## What is Nostr

Nostr stands for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays". Like HTTP or TCP-IP, Nostr is a protocol; an open standard upon which anyone can build. Nostr itself is not an app or service that you sign up for.

Nostr is designed for simplicity and enables censorship-resistant and globally decentralized publishing on the web. It can not only replace twitter but also will dominant all services aiming at busniess related to infomation exchange.
