## What is Nostr

Nostr stands for **Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays**. 

Nostr is not an app or service that you sign up for. Nostr is a permissionless open standard like TCP/IP and HTTP etc. Anyone can build on it without asking for permission from anyone. There is no one in control.

Nostr is designed for simplicity and enables people to participate in a decentralized social network. It can not only replace twitter but can also replace companies that provide infomation exchange services.
