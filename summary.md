## What is Nostr

Nostr stands for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays". Like HTTP or TCP-IP, Nostr is a protocol; an open standard upon which anyone can build. Nostr itself is not an app or service that you sign up for.

Nostr is designed for simplicity and enables people to participate in a decentralized social network. It can not only replace twitter but can also replace companies that provide infomation exchange services.
